puts """Darkness lurked around every narrow corner. everywhere he looked, cobwebs and dirt
mounds poluted the ground. Growing increasingly terrified by the second, #{name} felt the
need for a friend. Luckily he had one. #{dog} walked closely behind #{name} displaying 
bravery and loyalty as he barked viciously at the incoming creatures. They walked for hours
trying to find their way, but every direction sent them in an endless loop.  Things only 
got more dire as the sinister lord herself appeared. #{villain} stepped out from the shadows
among them and chanted a bloodcurdling curse which turned into a deafening screech. It is
I, Emily The Queen of Death! I shall harvest your souls and eat destroy you where you stand!
Fear instantly turned into a burst of adrenaline and determination for #{name} and #{dog} as
they got into a battle stance. #{name} drew his Longsword and #{dog}s fangs lit with flames,
penetrating the darkness with a faint glow of light. #{villain} gave an amused grin and 
casted a summoning spell causing skeletal warriors to burst angrily from the dirt bellow."""
